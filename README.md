# CoreDNS Operator

[CoreDNS][] is a flexible, plugin-based DNS server, and is the recommended
solution for providing DNS to Kubernetes services withiin the cluster.
This operator enables integration with [Charmed Kubernetes][] via a
cross-model relation and allows for more customization than provided by the
deployment of CoreDNS provided by default by Charmed Kubernetes.

More information on using this operator with Charmed Kubernetes can be found
[here](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/cdk-addons#coredns), and bugs should
be filed [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/charmed-kubernetes).
